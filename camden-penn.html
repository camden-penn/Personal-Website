<div name = "work_experience" class = "section">
	<strong>Summer 2017:</strong> SharePoint Developer, Samtec<br/><br/>
	I created Angular forms to enhance the default SharePoint user experience and workflows to automate certain administrative tasks.<br/><br/>

	<strong>August 2016 - Present:</strong> Teacher's Assistant, First-Year Engineering Program<br/><br/>
	I help my professors by assisting confused students; supplying students with materials in the design class, EGR 103; and writing and maintaining a utility script that interfaces with a particularly fragile part of MATLAB. The utility code, by one professor's estimation, has saved hundreds of hours of student frustration and teacher time.

	<strong>Fall 2016 - Present: UK Solar Car Team</strong><br/><br/>

	As a member of the Electrical Team, I help design and repair electrical systems on the solar car. The most high-profile of these is the battery protection and management system, which prevents our lithium-ion batteries from exploding.<br/><br/>

	Over the years, I learned enough leadership skills to eventually serve as the Senior Patrol Leader of the troop.
