			<span>WORK EXPERIENCE</span><br/>
			Summer 2017:<strong> SharePoint Developer</strong>, Samtec<br/><br/>
			I created Angular forms to enhance the default SharePoint user experience and workflows to automate certain administrative tasks.<br/><br/>

			August 2016 - Present:<strong> Teacher's Assistant</strong>, First-Year Engineering Program<br/><br/>
			I help my professors by assisting confused students; supplying students with materials in the design class, EGR 103; and writing and maintaining a utility script that interfaces with a particularly fragile part of MATLAB. This utility code, by one professor's estimation, has saved hundreds of hours of student frustration and teacher time.

			Winter 2009 - July 2016: <strong>Boy Scout Troop 306</strong><br/><br/>

			Over the years, I learned enough leadership skills to eventually serve as the Senior Patrol Leader of the troop.
